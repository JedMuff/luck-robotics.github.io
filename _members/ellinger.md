   I am Luna, a master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. My thesis, supervised by dr. Kevin Sebastian Luck, focuses on developing a bio-inspired curriculum learning approach. I study how a specific planthopper species (Issus coleoptratus) learns its jumping maneuvers and create robotic simulations that mimic its developmental stages to improve learning efficiency in reinforcement learning.
