I am a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. My research focuses on robot learning, particularly in the field of reinforcement learning for adaptive locomotion.

My primary interest lies in coadaptive learning, where both control policies and morphology evolve to optimize movement. Currently, my thesis explores reinforcement learning-based locomotion strategies for a snake robot, aiming to enhance adaptability across diverse environments.

Before my master's, I worked on research in social robotics, reinforcement learning, and quantum computing, with a focus on robotic embodiment and control theory.

Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Robot Learning, Coadaptive Systems.
