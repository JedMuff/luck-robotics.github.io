Welcome to the website of the CI Robot Learning Lab lead by Assist. Professor [Kevin Sebastian Luck](https://www.kevin-luck.com)! We are part of the [Computational Intelligence Group](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in The Netherlands.

Our group's research is centered broadly on robot learning, with a special focus on
 - Deep Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control & Robotics
 - Multi- and Cross-Embodiment Learning
 - Co-Design & Co-Optimization of Robot Design and Behaviour
 - Robot Learning Applications to Robot Manipulation and Locomotion
